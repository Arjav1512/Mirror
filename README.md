# Mirror Frontend

Modern React frontend built with Vite, React, and Tailwind CSS.

## Quick Start

```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Development server (with hot reload)
npm run dev

# Build for production
npm run build

# Preview production build
npm run preview
```

## Development

The dev server runs on http://localhost:3000 and proxies API requests to http://localhost:5001

## Production

After building, the `dist/` folder contains the production-ready static files, served by `backend/serve_react.py`
